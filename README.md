# Sudoku Solvers and Simplifiers

This project aims to implement different techniques for simplifying and solving sudokus.

Beware of breaking changes! The API is not stable at all!

For good descriptions of some techniques check out [Sudoku of the Day](https://www.sudokuoftheday.com/techniques/) (no affiliation)!

You can see the code in action at [sudokoin.com](https://sudokoin.com).

All help is greatly appreciated!
